Social networks are becoming more open, more interconnected, and more distributed. Many of us in the web creation world are embracing and promoting web standards - both client-side and server-side. Microformats, standard apis, and open-source software are key building blocks of these technologies. This model can be described as having three sides/legs/arms/spokes - pick your connection: Information, Identity, and Interaction.

DiSo (dee â€¢ zoh) is an umbrella project for a group of open source implementations of these _distributed social networking_ concepts. or as Chris [puts it](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/12/06/oauth-10-openid-20-and-up-next-diso/): "to build a social network with its skin inside out".

We believe in bootstrapping on existing work and building out from there - our first targets include [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com) and [Movable Type](http://movabletype.org), and we have folks involved who are working in [Drupal](http://drupal.org), TikiWiki, and various other platforms. If you're interested in the future of open standards in social software, join the [Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/diso-project) and follow along.
